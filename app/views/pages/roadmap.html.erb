<h2 class="subhead"><span>Road Map</span></h2>

<p>
    Privly and the associated browser extensions are an open source project, whose development is dictated by the passions and funding of its contributors. As such, this roadmap outlines development areas for the system, but not a timetable or ordering of deliverables. The best way for you to speed development is to <%= link_to "join the team", pages_join_path %> or <%= link_to "make a donation", pages_donate_path %>. As we near completion of major features, we will make announcements on the site, as well as on <%= link_to "Twitter.", "http://twitter.com/#!/Privly" %>
</p>

<p>
    Please note that items are marked <span class="developmentstatus developmentstatusdeveloping">under development</span> only if someone is currently working on that element.

        	    <li><em>Confederated Content:</em> Store your content anywhere. <span class="developmentstatus developmentstatusvapor">Not Under Development</span></li>
        	    <li><em>Anonymous Content:</em> Users can associate content with a secret key instead of a user account. <span class="developmentstatus developmentstatusvapor">Not Under Development</span></li>
        	    <li><em>Content Portability:</em> Users have the ability to export/import all their content to/from common formats. <span class="developmentstatus developmentstatusvapor">Not Under Development</span></li>
        	    <li><em>Content lifetime:</em> Users have the ability to define a lifetime for their content (e.g. automatically delete after 30 days) as well as purge their content entirely. <span class="developmentstatus developmentstatusdeveloping">Under Development</span></li>
        	    <li><em>GeoIP Based Restrictions:</em> No major platforms have sharing rules for geographic regions. While GeoIP is not a robust security measure, it does make it difficult to access content outside an intended area. <span class="developmentstatus developmentstatusvapor">Not Under Development</span></li>

        	    <li><em>Extension-side encryption/decryption:</em> With a reliable cryptography library we can generate keys and encrypt content before sending it to any content server. We have big plans for this feature once the core system is fully functional. <span class="developmentstatus developmentstatusdeveloping">Under Development</span></li>
        	    <li><em>Isolate returned content from host page:</em> The host page cannot have access to injected content. iframes provide a way to isolate the secure content from the unsecured webpage. <span class="developmentstatus developmentstatusreleased">Completed</span></li>
        	    <li><em>Differentiate remote content from page content (eliminate phishing risk):</em> Some malicious users may use Privly as a method of phishing by posting that looks like it originates from the host site.  The extension will make it obvious which content is from the host page and which content is from Privly. <span class="developmentstatus developmentstatusdeveloping">Under Development</span></li>
        	    <li><em>Prevent browser caching:</em> While it is likely impossible to prevent all forms of caching, the extension will provide some steps to ensure that content is not cached any longer than it needs to be. <span class="developmentstatus developmentstatusvapor">Not Under Development</span></li>
        	    <li><em>Isolate Privly Content from Other Extensions:</em> Privly content is currently injected into the frame using an iframe. While this method prevents the host site from reading the content, other extensions still have access to the displayed content. We need a solution to this problem. <span class="developmentstatus developmentstatusvapor">Not Under Development</span></li>
