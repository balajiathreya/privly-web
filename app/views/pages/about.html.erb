<h2 class="subhead"><span>About</span></h2>

<p>Your content should remain your content. At least at Privly, we think so. However, services like Facebook, Google, Twitter and the like, don’t seem to agree. Every time you blindly agree to their Terms of Service agreements, you are agreeing to allow them the right to do whatever they wish with your data. More often than not, that involves selling your privacy.</p>

<br />

<p>Privly works by giving the power and control back to the user and never selling your data. By simply installing our browser extension, you are able to keep your content, well, your content. For those who don’t have the extension installed, they see a simple link that sends them to your post, photo, video, etc. For those who do have the extension installed, they are able to see your post on the page as it was intended. That’s because the extension pulls the data and displays it on your Facebook page, Twitter profile, etc, seamlessly, without supplying that data to those respective companies. Meaning your content stays, your content.</p>

<br />

<p><b>Privly Does:</b></p>

<ul>
  <li>Give you the ability to share/post/tweet/chat anywhere without giving the host site access to the content</li>
  <li>Give you the power to grant or revoke access to your content to anyone or anywhere</li>
  <li>Give the content creator ownership of their data</li>
</ul>

<br />

<p><b>Privly Does Not:</b>
<ul>
  <li>Use or sell your data</li>
  <li>Give your data to third party companies</li>
  <li>Own your content, you do</li>
</ul></p>

<br />

<p>Privly has proven itself as a concept. You can use it right now with Facebook, Gmail, Google+, Twitter, Reddit, and just about anywhere else. As we refine the <%= link_to "Firefox extension", pages_download_path %> and develop versions for other browsers, we hope you will check back.
