## About ##

Privly is a developing set of browser extensions for protecting content wherever it is posted on the internet. It allows users to view content on any website, without the host site being able to read the content. This content server is meant to store content for users with a Privly extension.

For more information on what Privly is, [read about us](https://priv.ly/pages/about).

## Development Status ##

**[Burrowing Owl](https://github.com/privly/privly-organization/wiki/Burrowing) Alpha Version**

For information about our development path, please see the [central wiki](https://github.com/privly/privly-organization/wiki/Version-List).

We are in the process of integrating the [Privly applications](https://github.com/privly/privly-applications) repository into this rail server. The Privly-Web content server is currently maintained by [Sean McGregor](https://github.com/smcgregor), on behalf of the [Privly Foundation](http://www.privly.org).

## About this Content Server ##

This server currently supports:

* All the applications found in the [Privly Applications](https://github.com/privly/privly-applications) repository.
* Serialized JSON storage for any text content.
* Sharing by email, domain, and IP Address.

## Development Server Installation ##

These shell commands step through a standard installation.

    # Clone this repository
    git clone git://github.com/privly/privly-web.git
    cd privly-web
    
    # Copy configuration files
    cp config/environments/development.rb.example config/environments/development.rb
    #for mysql as database
        cp config/database.yml.mysql.example config/database.yml
    #for sqlite as database, if you did not setup a MySQL database
        #uncomment the gemfile line: gem 'sqlite3-ruby'
        #comment the gemfile line: gem 'mysql2'
        cp config/database.yml.sqlite.example config/database.yml
    
    # Get the privly application repository into the "public" dir.
    cd public
    # Clone the applications Git into "apps"
    git clone https://github.com/privly/privly-applications.git apps
    cd ..
    
    # Run installation scripts
    bundle install #Installs the required gems
    rake db:create #Creates the Database
    rake db:schema:load #Loads the Scheme
    rake db:seed #Seeds the DB
    rails server #Starts the server

## Managing Users

This content server can effectively be used by a single user, but you may also want to host for some friends. There is a rudimentary administrative interface you can login to at `/admin`.

The seed file will create several users for you in development, including: `admin@priv.ly`, `demonstration@priv.ly`, `development@priv.ly`. All these accounts have the same password, `password`. Use the admin account to login to the admin interface. Use the development account for logging into your development server.

**User Account States**  
User accounts could be in one of several states:

1. **Signed up for an invitation:** When a user submits their email to the invitation form, they do not automatically get an active account. You can invite the user via the administrative interface, or a user who has invitation credits can invite the user at a later date.
1. **Invited:** A user who has been invited by an administrator or a user with invitation credits has been "invited." They need to verify their email address before they may begin creating content.
1. **Can Post:** The user can create content on the server. This is usually the state after the user has verified their email address and has paid whatever toll they need to support hosting expenses.
1. **Can't Post:** In order to create new content on the server, a user must have posting permission. You will only generally use this option if the user is abusing the content server or not contributing enough to hosting costs. There is no option for locking a user account completely, because they should maintain access to content they have already created.

## Testing/Submitting Bugs ##

If you have discovered a bug, only [open a public issue](https://github.com/privly/privly-web/issues/new) on GitHub if it could not possibly be a security related bug. If the bug affects the security of the system, please report it privately at [privly.org](http://www.privly.org/content/bug-report). If it is an urgent issue, please email privly@privly.org. We will then fix the bug and follow a process of responsible disclosure.
