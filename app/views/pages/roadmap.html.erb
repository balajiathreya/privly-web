<h2 class="subhead"><span>Road Map</span></h2>

<p>
    Privly and the associated browser extensions are an open source project, whose development is dictated by the passions and funding of its contributors. As such, this roadmap outlines development areas for the system, but not a timetable or ordering of deliverables. The best way for you to speed development is to <%= link_to "join the team", pages_join_path %> or <%= link_to "make a donation", pages_donate_path %>. As we near completion of major features, we will make announcements on the site, as well as on <%= link_to "Twitter.", "http://twitter.com/#!/Privly" %>
</p>

    Please note that items are marked <span class="developmentstatus developmentstatusdeveloping">under development</span> only if someone is currently working on that element.

    <h1>Development Priorities</h1>
    <div id="roadmap_accordion">

        <h2><a id="accordion_ubiquity" href="#accordion_ubiquity">1. Platform Ubiquity</a></h2>
        <div>
            <p>Anyone you designate can read your content on the priv.ly website, but what sets the Privly protocol apart is the ability to pull your content into any site on the web. We want the first Priv.ly link anyone follows to be their last. The first priority must be to bring the Privly system to as many platforms as possible.</p>
            <ul class="posts">
                <li><em>Browsers:</em> Several browser extensions are under active development. We usually develop features on the Mozilla platform, then port the code to other systems.<span class="developmentstatus developmentstatusdeveloping">Under Development</span></li>
                <li><em>Mobile:</em> Privly is primarily for personal content, and content generated or viewed on mobile devices fits that description. Development begins on the desktop, but the Privly protocol has a home in mobile.<span class="developmentstatus developmentstatusvapor">Not Under Development</span></li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <h2><a id="accordion_ownership" href="#accordion_ownership">2. Content Ownership</a></h2>
        <div>
            <p>Privly will never assert content ownership, but that promise is meaningless without providing ways for users to move their content into and out of content hosts.</p>
        	<ul class="posts">
        	    <li><em>Content Server:</em> Users have a default server to post private content. The <%= link_to "server source code", "https://github.com/smcgregor/privly-web" %> is available for anyone to download and extend. As soon as we can guarantee browsing anonymity, anyone can host their own content.<span class="developmentstatus developmentstatusdeveloping">Under Development</span></li>
        	    <li><em>Content Portability:</em> Users have the ability to export/import all their content to/from common formats. <span class="developmentstatus developmentstatusvapor">Not Under Development</span></li>
        	    <li><em>Content lifetime:</em> Users have the ability to define a lifetime for their content (e.g. automatically delete after 30 days) as well as purge their content entirely. <span class="developmentstatus developmentstatusdeveloping">Under Development</span></li>
            </ul>
        </div>
    
        <h2><a id="accordion_security" href="#accordion_security">3. Security</a></h2>
        <div>
        	<ul class="posts">
        	    <li><em>Extension-side encryption/decryption:</em> With a reliable cryptography library we can generate keys and encrypt content before sending it to any content server. We have big plans for this feature once the core system is fully functional. <span class="developmentstatus developmentstatusdeveloping">Under Development</span></li>
        	    <li><em>Isolate returned content from host page:</em> The host page cannot have access to injected content. Pages hosting Privly links do not have access to the linked content. <span class="developmentstatus developmentstatusreleased">Completed</span></li>
        	    <li><em>Differentiate remote content from page content (eliminate phishing risk):</em> Some malicious users may use Privly as a method of phishing by posting that looks like it originates from the host site.  The extension will make it obvious which content is from the host page and which content is from Privly. <span class="developmentstatus developmentstatusdeveloping">Under Development</span></li>
        	    <li><em>Prevent browser caching:</em> While it is likely impossible to prevent all forms of caching, the extension will provide some steps to ensure that content is not cached any longer than it needs to be. <span class="developmentstatus developmentstatusvapor">Not Under Development</span></li>
        	    <li><em>Isolate Privly Content from Other Extensions:</em> Privly content is currently injected into the frame using an iframe. While this method prevents the host site from reading the content, other extensions still have access to the displayed content. We need a solution to this problem. <span class="developmentstatus developmentstatusvapor">Not Under Development</span></li>
        	    <li><em>Anonymous Content:</em> Users can associate content with a secret key instead of a user account. <span class="developmentstatus developmentstatusvapor">Not Under Development</span></li>
            </ul>
        </div>
    
        <h2><a id="accordion_share" href="#accordion_share">4. Share Everywhere</a></h2>
        <div>
            <p>There are numerous ways to identify who you want to share something with. Content should be permissioned by whichever platform you want.</p>
        	<ul class="posts">
        	    <li><em>Share by Email</em> <span class="developmentstatus developmentstatusdeveloping">Under Development</span></li>
        	    <li><em>Share by Password</em> <span class="developmentstatus developmentstatusvapor">Not Under Development</span></li>

        	    <li><em>Share by Diaspora Aspect, Google+ Circle, Twitter List, etc</em> <span class="developmentstatus developmentstatusvapor">Not Under Development</span></li>
        	    <li><em>GeoIP Based Restrictions:</em> No major platforms have sharing rules for geographic regions. While GeoIP is not a robust security measure, it does make it difficult to access content outside an intended area. <span class="developmentstatus developmentstatusvapor">Not Under Development</span></li>
            </ul>

        <h2><a id="accordion_looks" href="#accordion_looks">5. Make it Look Good</a></h2>
        <div>
        	<ul class="posts">
        	    <li><em>Allow for Site-Specific CSS:</em> Privly content should identify itself, but should also fit its context. User submitted or host-page CSS should provide generalized styling of text content.<span class="developmentstatus developmentstatusvapor">Not Under Development</span></li>
        	    <li><em>Provide Domain Specific Language (DSL):</em> Markdown is an excellent starting point for generating HTML for page injection, but it is not intended for systems like Privly. A DSL could solve many formatting problems. <span class="developmentstatus developmentstatusvapor">Not Under Development</span></li>
        	    <li><em>Non-text Content:</em> Private information is not limited to text, and neither is Privly.<span class="developmentstatus developmentstatusvapor">Not Under Development</span></li>
            </ul>
        </div>
    
        <h2><a id="accordion_other" href="#accordion_other">6. Other Items</a></h2>
        <div>
            <ul class="posts">
                <li><em>Peer-to-peer storage:</em> Once data is encrypted, it doesn't matter where you store it. Success of systems like BitTorrent and Bitcoin suggest ways to decentralize storage, but we need to extend their ideas to ensure that browsing anonymity is maintained. Privly's researchers find this aspect fascinating, so we will probably revisit this soon.<span class="developmentstatus developmentstatusvapor">Not Under Development</span></li>
                <li><em>Personal Semantic Datastore:</em> Text conversations are not the only type of personal information. Many exciting applications rely on declarations of who you are. When you give Facebook your date of birth, hometown, and likes, you give them a rich dataset that is shared with third-party applications. An anonymized and encrypted personal information database would make it easier for you to use exciting functionality without allowing companies to correlate your personal information with a database of marketing information. You are the customer, not the product.<span class="developmentstatus developmentstatusvapor">Not Under Development</span></li>
