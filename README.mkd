# Privly Development Server

This application hosts the content injected into websites by Privly extensions. Since any server technology could potentially support the (under development) Privly standard, this server is the [reference implementation](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reference_implementation) for fully private hosting of Privly content.

**System Status: Pre-Alpha**

For more information on what Privly is, see https://priv.ly.

The development home of Privly is at http://www.privly.org/. For information on how to join the Privly community, read this: http://www.privly.org/content/welcome-privly-development
