      <div>
        <p>This section is dedicated to describing the parties with any level of access to information transmitted to Privly, or inferable from those transmissions. We are actively working to reduce the necessary disclosures of this list to the final item.</p>

        <h3>The Privly Foundation: Code Updates, System Administration</h3>
        <p>
          You are currently trusting Privly's system administration capabilities. Active system administrators include Sean McGregor (the content server), and Hanno Wagner (test.privly.org, doc.privly.org). We are working to reduce all trust and reliance on content hosts by developing the client-side encryption capabilities of Privly.
        </p>
        
        <br />
        
        <h3>Rackspace: Virtual Private Server Host</h3>
        <p>
          Our host could likely gain root access on our server. Doing so without legal action by the US government could jeopardize their massive hosting business.
        </p>
        
        <br />
        
        <h3>GoDaddy: DNS, privlyalpha.org Registrar</h3>
        <p>
          The Alpha version of the server has DNS through GoDaddy, and the domain is registered through their servers. We need to do a critical evaluation of all the DNS and domain registrars available.
        </p>
        
        <br />
        
        <h3>thoughtbot and Airbrake: Error Logging Service</h3>
        <p>
          Privly uses the Airbrake error logging service for recording and managing errors in the Privly content server. In some instances this could lead to Airbrake obtaining information available to Privly. We will consider switching to a self-hosted solution when we transition to the Beta version.
        </p>
        
        <br />
        
        <h3>Mozilla, Opera, Google: Extension Distribution</h3>
        <p>
          The Privly extensions are distributed by their respective browsers. We trust them to distribute unmodified versions of Privly. If you don't trust Mozilla, Opera, or Google to distribute the original extension, you should download the extension's source code directly from the Privly repository.
        </p>
        
        <br />
        
        <h3>Our Users: Understanding</h3>
        <p>
          Privly is a new concept under active development. We can build Privly, but unless our users understand Privly capabilities, they will not be able to protect their content with Privly.

      <h2><a id="accordion_trademark" href="#accordion_trademark">Privly Trademark FAQ</a></h2>
      <div>
        <h2>How can I use the name "Privly"?</h2>
        <p>The <%= link_to "Privly Foundation", "http://www.privly.org" %> encourages developers to use the name Privly in ways that do not confuse the public about the source of privacy software and services. If you are building open-source non-commercial software or services that incorporate or work with The Privly Project's code, you may use the name "Privly" in an accurate description of your work. We ask you to include a link to the official Privly website <%= link_to "https://priv.ly", "https://priv.ly" %> so users can verify the original source of Privly for themselves, and a note indicating that your project is not sponsored by The Privly Foundation. For example, "This product is produced independently from the Privly&trade; privacy software and carries no guarantee from The Privly Foundation about quality, suitability or anything else."</p>
        <br />
        <h2>Can I use the Privly logo?</h2>
        <p>If you're making non-commercial use of Privly software, you may also use the Privly logo (as an illustration, not as a brand for your products). Please don't modify the design or colors of the logo. You can use items that look like the Privly logo to illustrate a point (e.g. the Privly logo in composition with a browser, for instance), so long as they're not used as logos in ways that would confuse people.</p>
        <br />
        <h2>Can I use the word "Privly" as part of the name of my product or my domain name?</h2>
        <p>We recommend that you don't do this, but rather find a name that will accurately identify your products or services. Remember that our goal is to make sure that people aren't confused about whether your product or project is made or endorsed by The Privly Project. Creating a new brand that incorporates the Privly brand is likely to lead to confusion.</p>
        <br />
        <h2>Does this mean you're enforcing trademark rights?</h2>
        <p>The Privly Foundation is a non-profit corporation organized to research and develop the Privly privacy software and network. We don't want to be trademark bullies, but we will use trademark to protect the public's ability to recognize Privly Project software. Trademark law helps us to assure that the name is used only in connection with genuine Privly privacy software and for accurate description of software and services. After all, to protect their privacy securely, computer users must be able to identify the software they are using, so they can account properly for its strengths and weaknesses. We work with developers to improve the software and actively encourage researchers to document attacks to help us strengthen its privacy protection further. We distribute the software itself freely, but require correct attribution.</p>
        <br />
        <h2>What if I produce non-open source, commercial products based on Privly?</h2>
        <p>Contact us, and let's talk.</p>
        <br />
        <h2>What is the difference between Privly and Priv.ly?</h2>
        <p>Priv.ly hosts a list of Privly compliant hosts, and is used for marketing Privly. The Privly name is pending a formal trademark, and Priv.ly is a "Domain Hack" of the Privly trademark and enjoys the same protections as Privly.</p>
