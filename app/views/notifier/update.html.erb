<p>Hello <%= @user.email %>,</p>

<p>Thanks for signing up for an invitation on <%= link_to "Priv.ly", "https://priv.ly" %>!</p>

<p>We are still in the testing and development phase of the project, but we are already issuing test accounts to developers, designers, and donors. There is one week left in our <%= link_to "Kickstarter Campaign", "http://kck.st/FQnKcu" %>, so please consider making a pledge (we'll give you a test account after you pledge). Test accounts are useful for trying Privly with your favorite web communities, but don't post anything that can't be public until we build in more security.</p>

<p>
Check us out on Twitter, and remember to tell your friends how Privly lets you: 
    <ul>
        <li>Maintain control of your content wherever you post it</li>
        <li>Delete emails after you send them (no more send regret)</li>
        <li>Share content across social networks, email, blogs, and forums using the same privacy settings</li>
        <li>Prevent governments from shutting down free speech</li>
        <li>Prevent companies from selling and scanning your most private communications</li>
        <li>Have easy use of modern encryption technologies</li>
    </ul>

PS: Kickstarter doesn't distribute Backers' email addresses, so you'll have to message us your email on Kickstarter before we can issue you an account. Are you a developer, tester, graphic designer, crypo-expert, or all-round awesome individual? <%= link_to "Join Us!", pages_join_url %>
