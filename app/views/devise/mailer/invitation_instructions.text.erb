Hello <%= @resource.email %>!

Someone has invited you to <%= root_url %>, you can accept it through the link below.

Privly is currently in Alpha Testing. The extension works on most sites, but there are bugs. When you find a problem, make sure you report a bug so we can fix the problem for you. There are bound to be some rough edges when you are interfacing with the entire internet, but in most cases, Privly will work wherever you bring it.

***Software in Alpha testing is not secure.*** If you want to use Privly with private data, you should wait until the Beta release.

Accept invitation: <%= accept_invitation_url(@resource, :invitation_token => @resource.invitation_token) %>.

Follow our Twitter for updates: https://twitter.com/#!/Privly.


    Thanks for the Support, and let us know how it goes!
