          Privly enables you to securely send and receive content through online services, without those services having access to the content. Privly works by extending browsers to look for specially formatted links, which are then "injected" into the pages you are viewing. Privly is a Foundation owned concept being made by and for all internet users. For more information about what Privly is, read our <%= link_to "about page." %></p></div>

        <div style="text-align: justify;">
          <p>The Chrome and Firefox versions of the extension are currently in Alpha testing, which means they are usable but not finished. You should not expect privacy or security from any software before it is reaches a Beta version (Beta versions release after Alpha versions). The current Chrome and Firefox versions of Privly offer the following guarantees:</p>
          <p>
            <strong>Privacy:</strong> Privly currently has two Applications (see "Privly Applications" below), and each one offers its own privacy guarantees. Content created with the ZeroBin application is encrypted before transmission for storage. People will be able to read your content if they have access to the content server and the link you share around the web. Content created using a Privly "PlainPost" is stored unencrypted by the content server. Anyone you give access to the content's link will be able to read the content.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Sharing:</strong> The reference implementation of the Privly Content server currently allows you to permission content by email, domain, and IP address. These sharing rules can restrict who has access to your data, but they do not change what information Privly has access to.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Organization:</strong> <%= link_to "Kickstarter", "http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/229630898/protect-your-content-anywhere-on-the-web-privly" %> donations in April of 2012 lead to the founding of the Privly Foundation, a non-profit dedicated to online Privacy software and education.

        <h2><a href="#">What is Next?</a></h2>
        <div style="text-align: justify;">
          <p><strong>Information for Everyone:</strong> We are working to make the system more secure, and to decrease the number of parties you must trust with your data. The next version will offer more encryption capabilities.</p>
          <p><strong>Information for Developers:</strong> The Chrome extension recently reached a major development milestone and is working towards a security review. Join the Privly development mailing list for system discussion, <%= link_to "Development Mailing List", "https://groups.google.com/group/privly" %>, or join our <%= link_to "IRC channel", "http://www.privly.org/content/irc" %>.</p>

        <h2><a href="#">Privly Hosts</a></h2>
        <div style="text-align: justify;"><p>The Google Chrome browser extension allows users to whitelist any content server for content injection. Developers and testers can ask for an account on the <%= link_to "Alpha Server", "https://privlyalpha.org" %>, but unaffiliated groups and individuals are welcome to experiment with their own content hosts. If you are hosting a Privly content server, notify the <%= link_to "Development Mailing List", "https://groups.google.com/group/privly" %>.</p></div>
        
        <h2><a href="#">(Developers Only) Privly Applications</a></h2>
        <div style="text-align: justify;"><p>When Privly securely injects content into sites like Facebook, the injected content has its own scripting environment. The "injectable application" abstraction frees content for uses and security models not imagined by the Privly core development team. However, allowing arbitrary code to execute with the injected content is dangerous for user data and the user's cryptographic identities. To enable advanced security and communication technologies within the Privly system, Privly will verify the security guarantees of applications for addition to the Privly network. Anyone can develop and submit applications for addition to the Privly network.</p></div>
