        <h2>When Will Privly Reach an Open Beta?</h2>
        <p>Privly will reach an open Beta when it has a stable extension for 80 percent of the market, and server capacity to meet projected demand. We will not get there without help, so please consider <%= link_to "joining the team.", pages_join_path %> We also want to know if you would use the system, so please sign up for an <%= link_to "invitation", new_invitation_path %> if you want to keep us coding.</p>

        <h2>Can I Serve Content Through a Privly Link?</h2>
        <p>For the time being, content must be served from Privly servers. Before we open up an API for other content servers, we need to secure the extensions and provide a mechanism for whitelisting content hosts. Privly extensions needs to prevent phishing, scripting attacks, and the tracking of our readers. You can help us get to an API by <%= link_to "joining the team.", pages_join_path %></p>

        <h2>Are You Competing with <%= link_to "Diaspora", "http://joindiaspora.org" %>?</h2>
        <p>Privly does <strong>not</strong> want to be another social network. Diaspora is a solid foundation for secure sharing, but you can't share Diaspora content securely everywhere. We can change that by injecting link content into secure page elements. We want to reduce Diaspora, and all social networks to their core offering: a social graph. They do not need your content, they need a reference to your content.</p>
        <br/>
        <p>Privly's goal is to set a new standard, whereby only the content creators and their designees have access to the cleartext. Privly, Diaspora, Facebook, Google, Twitter, <i>et al.</i> never need access.</p>
